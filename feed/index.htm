<p>This blog post shares the experience of an SDSN delegate to the Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) Climate Week 2023 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Giovanna Antoniassi Aires Garcia shares her educational and leadership experiences from the summit.</p>

<p>Recognition for the importance of young voices in international affairs, when dealing with global conflicts has significantly increased over the years. Within this consideration, I am deeply thankful to have had the opportunity to attend MENA Climate Week 2023, hosted in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Thanks to Foundations for Leadership (FLL), The United Nations Sustainable Development Network (UN SDSN) and the Ministry of Tourism of Saudi Arabia, I got to engage in invigorating discussions on Climate Change, ranging from the global, national, and local levels.&nbsp; Through the organization of leading partners such as UNDP, UNEP, UN Climate Change, World Bank Group, and others,&nbsp; I met some incredible individuals from all over the world, I can confidently say that our gathering of minds, knowledge, and passion <em>will </em>make change for the better of our future!</p>



<p>I had the incredible chance to moderate a panel on Multi-Sectoral Mobilization and Regional Adaptation for Seas Without Plastic with the Mohammed VI Foundation for Environmental Protection. Undoubtedly, my experience as a moderator was unforgettable and immensely impactful. Despite not being directly involved with the region, I was so inspired by the words of the panelists that it gave me the desire to create my own actionable steps for change. I was born in Goiânia, Brazil, and moved to Miami, Florida when I was 9 years old, I have been living in Miami for 10 years and am currently a student at the University of Miami. This year will be my fifth year coaching sailing here in Miami for Coral Reef Yacht Club. My personal background truly merged with what was brought up in the discussion because despite the focus being on the Middle East and North Africa regions, the topic at hand was the removal of plastics from the ocean, a matter of great concern in Florida. This is due to the significant threats it poses, especially to our extensive coral reef barrier which is the largest in the United States. &nbsp;This inspired me to translate the knowledge gained from the panel into actionable change; dedicating a day for my students and me to venture out into the ocean to collect plastic debris, contributing to the ongoing efforts to preserve our marine environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The experience of moderating allowed me to bring this national initiative to a local one,&nbsp; and the immersion had a personal influence on my life, and if more youth delegates got this opportunity I can only imagine the global harmony of initiatives that would come as a consequence. I want to commend MENACW for their global efforts to make youth involvement in events like this possible, and as a student who truly thrives off new experiences, I believe that there can be ways to optimize youth involvement opportunities for an even better outcome!</p>



<p>The conference held extremely insightful and inspiring main panels discussing a wide range of topics. However, at the parallel youth events, I couldn&#8217;t help but think about the wealth of untapped potential that lay within the vibrant student population present at MENA Climate Week. You see, parallel lines never intersect; I believe that our youth forums should definitely intersect with those main panels!&nbsp; It is crucial to recognize that youth have a unique perspective, unbridled creativity, and an unwavering commitment to environmental sustainability. Incorporating their voices into the main panel discussions could have ignited a level of engagement and involvement that would be unparalleled, resulting in a more profound and lasting impact.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to emphasize that promoting youth voice inclusion entails differentiating between active participation and presence. Engaging in meaningful discussions can drive substantial change, and the greater the number of voices heard, the more impactful the outcomes can be. A single voice can create an echo, so imagine the power of numerous voices. And after all, everyone deserves a seat at the table, just like in the United Nations.</p>



<p>&nbsp;So, what 7 things should we keep in mind when trying to engage youth in a meaningful way that drives outcomes?</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Recognize and Value Youth Voices: </strong>Acknowledge the importance of including youth perspectives in global events and discussions. Understand that their unique insights, creativity, and commitment can lead to meaningful change.</li>



<li><strong>Connect Global and Local Contexts:</strong> Encourage discussions and initiatives that bridge the global with the local. Find common ground where global issues align with regional concerns, allowing youth to relate their experiences and expertise to broader challenges.</li>



<li><strong>Empower Action: </strong>Facilitate opportunities for youth to translate knowledge into action. Inspire them to take tangible steps toward positive change, such as organizing local initiatives or projects based on the insights gained from global events.</li>



<li><strong>Foster Inclusivity: </strong>Promote an inclusive environment where youth are active participants in meaningful discussions rather than passive observers. Ensure their voices are heard, valued, and integrated into the broader dialogue.</li>



<li><strong>Collaborate Across Generations:</strong> Encourage intergenerational collaboration. Allow youth forums to intersect with main panels, creating opportunities for cross-generational discussions, knowledge sharing, and mentorship.</li>



<li><strong>Amplify the Impact of Youth Voices:</strong> Recognize that collective action is more powerful. Encourage collaboration among youth, enabling them to work together to drive change on a larger scale.</li>



<li><strong>Continuously Optimize Youth Engagement:</strong> Regularly assess and refine strategies for engaging youth effectively. Seek feedback from young participants and stakeholders to adapt and improve the engagement process for better outcomes.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>By Lorcán Hall</em></p>



<p>The scale of the challenges facing our global society can feel paralysing. Indeed, the waves of information hitting us daily appear to excessively focus on the problems at the expense of championing successes. How might we deepen our understanding of these challenges, ideate novel solutions, and scale innovations that already exist today? </p>



<p>This question fueled my recent Master’s of Science in Sustainable Development studies at University College Dublin (UCD) in partnership with the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN). Global academics, policymakers, and practitioners lead this pioneering course.&nbsp;Importantly,&nbsp;it is designed to inspire and empower students to take action.&nbsp;Plus, its online delivery enables students from across the world to participate, providing unique opportunities to learn from and collaborate with peers.</p>



<p>I highly recommend this course and the accompanying portfolio of SDG Academy courses. In this blog, I will share my personal motivation for pursuing the MSc., explain how it links to my professional career and ambitions, and offer my thoughts on how other experienced professionals can use the science and solutions taught in this course to reorientate their careers towards sustainable development.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The motivation for my SDG knowledge journey</strong></p>



<p>My father retired due to ill-health in his mid-40s.&nbsp;Fortunately, his disability pension was supplemented with voluntary private disability insurance, acutely illustrating the value of public and private financial safety nets to my family.&nbsp;This experience was a key factor in my decision to join the insurance industry in 1998.&nbsp;I later learned that the guiding principle sitting at the heart of insurance is that ‘many pay for the few,’ meaning that many people pay insurance premiums so that a few people receive financial support when they experience unwanted events such as illnesses and natural disasters.</p>



<p>In general, there are two groups of insurance: social protection programmes funded by government revenues and voluntary solutions available from private insurance companies.&nbsp;My professional experience has been exclusively in the latter category; but, at times, I have struggled to articulate the societal value of insurance, particularly to people outside the industry.&nbsp;The Covid-19 pandemic and the climate emergency sparked my desire to address this knowledge gap and understand how insurance solutions might play a stronger role in addressing our interconnected challenges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My journey started with the excellent online SDG Academy course, <em><a href="https://www.edx.org/learn/social-science/sdg-academy-age-of-sustainable-development" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Age of Sustainable Development</span></a></em>.&nbsp; Delivered by Professor Jeffrey Sachs, a world-renowned expert on sustainable development, the course describes the 17 SDGs across their four pillars of economic prosperity, social inclusion, environmental sustainability, and good governance.&nbsp;Surprisingly, insurance was referenced several times in this course, inviting me to dive deeper into the SDGs via the Master&#8217;s programme.</p>



<p><strong>Insurance &amp; the SDGs</strong></p>



<p>Once I began studying, I quickly learned that there is a compelling symmetry between insurance and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development with ‘many pay for the few’ echoed in the 2030 Agenda’s central promise to ‘Leave No One Behind.’ Throughout my studies, I located numerous examples of how the solidarity principle of insurance powers progress across the SDGs. Three examples bring this to life:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><img decoding="async" width="237" height="237" src="https://sdgacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Picture2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4498" srcset="https://sdgacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Picture2.png 237w, https://sdgacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Picture2-100x100.png 100w, https://sdgacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Picture2-180x180.png 180w" sizes="(max-width: 237px) 100vw, 237px" /></figure></div>


<p><strong>SDG 1 &#8211; No Poverty: </strong>Today, almost <a href="https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2022/goal-01/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">700 million people live in extreme poverty</span></a>, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-forgotten-3-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3.4 billion people are vulnerable to falling into poverty</span></a>, and <a href="https://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_817653/lang--en/index.htm#:~:text=Currently%2C%20only%2047%20per%20cent,regional%20inequalities%20in%20social%20protection." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4.1 billion people, 53% of the world’s population, do not have access to any type of social protection</span></a>. Voluntary private insurance solutions can play an important role to plug some of this protection gap. These solutions should not replace the universal social protection ambitions in SDG <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Target 1.3</span></a>. Rather, they are complementary as they facilitate access to financial supports to customers who can afford insurance premiums, thereby minimising the strain on stretched publicly funded social protection systems. It’s not public OR private; it’s public AND private.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><img decoding="async" width="237" height="237" src="https://sdgacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Picture3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4497" srcset="https://sdgacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Picture3.png 237w, https://sdgacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Picture3-100x100.png 100w, https://sdgacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Picture3-180x180.png 180w" sizes="(max-width: 237px) 100vw, 237px" /></figure></div>


<p><strong>SDG 3 &#8211; Good Health &amp; Well-being: </strong>Universal health coverage is critical, but the Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the fragility and underfunding of our healthcare infrastructures, making it difficult to achieve SDG <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Target 3.8</span></a>. In 2019, before the pandemic, about <a href="https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2023/The-Sustainable-Development-Goals-Report-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1 billion people spent more than 10% of their household budget on out of pocket health expenses and close to 400 million people were (further) pushed into extreme property due to these expenses</span></a>. Again, public healthcare systems can benefit from regulated voluntary insurance markets, as the latter facilitates access to private health services and financial supports to populations who can afford insurance premiums. This allows public healthcare systems to focus their limited resources on vulnerable groups that cannot afford voluntary insurance. In effect, people who are relatively healthy and wealthy subsidise people who are sick and poor. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="237" height="237" src="https://sdgacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Picture4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4496" srcset="https://sdgacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Picture4.png 237w, https://sdgacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Picture4-100x100.png 100w, https://sdgacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Picture4-180x180.png 180w" sizes="(max-width: 237px) 100vw, 237px" /></figure></div>


<p><strong>SDG 13 &#8211; Climate Action: </strong>Insurance supports mitigation and adaptation efforts in various ways. As we know, from a mitigation perspective, investments are required to transform the energy system. Insurance is key to enabling this energy transition, as, for the most part, <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/03/SRREN_Full_Report-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">insurance solutions are essential to mobilise private capital towards these clean energy projects</span></a>. In parallel, the growing number of extreme weather events demand adaptation solutions to support populations impacted by climate-related hazards and natural disasters as outlined in SDG <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal13" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Target 13.1</span></a>. <a href="https://www.swissre.com/dam/jcr:1d793484-9b96-4e54-91c3-09f8fc841bde/2023-05-sigma-01-english.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Global economic losses from natural disasters totaled USD 275 billion in 2022 but only 45% of these losses were insured</span></a>. This creates a massive protection gap, disproportionately affecting poor and vulnerable populations. As the impact of climate change intensifies across the globe, there is a greater need for all types of insurance to fuel adaptation initiatives.</p>



<p>It is important to emphasise that while I explored the MSc. material through an insurance lens, others will find the SDGs relevant to their personal and professional lives in many different ways.</p>



<p><strong>Teaching Old Dogs New Tricks</strong></p>



<p>There are first-rate SDG educational initiatives targeting primary, secondary, and tertiary students; yet we cannot only wait for younger generations to grow into positions of power and influence to drive the urgently required change.&nbsp;More work is required to provide experienced professionals with scientifically anchored and solutions-focused SDG knowledge.</p>



<p>Frequently, there is a misconception that the SDGs are for “the public sector and poor countries,” but my knowledge journey has completely dispelled this myth. The need for solidarity is rising rapidly across all developed and developing nations with events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and extreme weather events demonstrating how interconnected and uncertain the globe is becoming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Insurance offers greater resilience in the face of this increasingly complex world; however, it is only one of various solutions that are available today.&nbsp;Welcomingly, many of these solutions are known and exist somewhere on our planet. But how might we, experienced professionals, equip ourselves with the knowledge required to move from discussing societal challenges to substantive action across the public and private spheres?</p>



<p>The MSc. in Sustainable Development from UCD and SDSN provided me with the solution I was looking for. Recognising that experienced professionals often have limited time, there are several flexible options available: the SDG Academy offers <a href="https://sdgacademy.org/courses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">more than 40 high-quality courses</span></a>, presenting pathways to obtain an <a href="https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/sdgacademyx-masters-pathway-in-foundations-of-sustainable-development" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">edX Professional Certificate</span></a>, a <a href="https://hub.ucd.ie/usis/!W_HU_MENU.P_PUBLISH?p_tag=PROG&amp;MAJR=T392" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">UCD Professional Diploma</span></a>, and the <a href="https://hub.ucd.ie/usis/!W_HU_MENU.P_PUBLISH?p_tag=PROG&amp;MAJR=W485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MSc. in Sustainable Development</span></a>. The SDG Academy has also partnered with LinkedIn Learning to offer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/instructors/sdg-academy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">micro-courses</span></a> on its platform. Stand-alone or together, these courses present compelling opportunities to acquire the knowledge to innovate and scale solutions that will create a brighter, more sustainable future for everyone. </p>

<p>During the week of October 8th, 2023 I attended the Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) Climate Week 2023 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia as a Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) delegate. For me, the conference started in the hotel lobby. The familiar traditional Malaysian Baju Melayu attire and sounds of the Bahasa dialect surrounding me reminded me of my experience living in Malaysia a couple of years ago. Attracted to familiarity, I was drawn to converse with the Malaysian students, reminiscing about my experiences in their country and reviving my little Bahasa language skills that, until that moment, had been unused. In talking with them, I noticed the different educational backgrounds of the group. This led me to ask, given their diverse backgrounds, about their relationship with sustainable development.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We went over ideas we have for ways in which youth can be engaged with sustainable development challenges and contribute to solutions. Upon talking to other student groups as well, I found that there was a recurring idea, and it was that educational institutions could present youth capacity-building mediums; these institutions can present resources to develop small-scale projects that address development challenges and access, through their networks, to platforms where students can contribute to large-scale projects targeting sustainable development solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I found the interactions with my colleagues particularly important as they unveiled, at that moment, the contributive nature of youth in relation to development issues. The excitement that beamed in their eyes and the passion in their body language when discussing sustainable development, to me, was indicative that the future is now. As youth, we have many ambitious ideas and perspectives to contribute but oftentimes lack the resources and access to meaningfully participate in enacting them. This informed my position on a panel I participated in entitled “Ambitions for the Future of&nbsp; Sustainable Tourism: The Big Picture” where I had the opportunity to represent a youth perspective on how we can be engaged.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The biggest lesson that I left Riyadh with is that the future is now. Youth need to gain experience in practical action today to be fortified into the strong leadership needed tomorrow. To be part of rooms with youth from other cultural and educational backgrounds, private and public sector representatives, and to be able to make contributions to discussion topics was enlightening for me. There were numerous times when other young people, including myself, would question their presence and value at the summit. Yet, our experience in such rooms responded to this question, as there was so much value in our contributions in the way they set the tone and guided conversations. For example, I participated in an interactive session held by YOUNGO where two company representatives sat at my table along with students from other countries. It was refreshing to see that as youths at that table, we provided valuable insights for those individuals’ projects in the private sector.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Beyond the educational experience, attending the summit provided me an insight into Saudi Arabian culture. I gained a new favorite dessert during this trip and developed a liking for camel milk. During the evenings after attending the conference, we were spoilt with tours and dinners. The last night in Riyadh was particularly striking. Not only did I get to eat delicious food in a restaurant called Villa Mamas at Bujairi Terrace, but I was left with an obsession with Umm Ali–a desert I got to eat there. Following the dinner, we got to explore the At-Turaif District which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. To experience closely a part of Riyadh’s history evoked feelings that for me are indescribable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My interactions at the Climate Week 2023 conference and cultural experiences in the city contributed to my learning as a Master of Development Practice student attending the University of Waterloo. I gained knowledge on current developments regarding sustainable development and climate action that go beyond in-class conversations. I also got to experience a different culture, allowing me to value different perspectives. Being exposed to the MENA Climate Week space in Riyadh and being able to network with individuals in the development practice sphere provided me with a better understanding of what contributions I want to make through my education and future career in development practice.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>



<p>To be a global leader and practice development around the world requires global experiences, and it is through such out-of-classroom experiences that we get to apply our education and gain practical experience. I am truly grateful to have been able to take part in MENA Climate Week 2023 as an SDSN delegate. Many thanks to our hosts in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia at the Ministry of Tourism for such a unique experience.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In September 2023, on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, the SDG Academy launched its latest collaboration with UNESCO, the Joint Committee on the OER Recommendation. The announcement came during a session hosted at the SDG Summit convened at UN Headquarters in New York.</p>



<p>The Joint Committee was signed into agreement just prior to the Summit with leadership from SDSN and UNESCO. Signing on behalf of SDSN was Patrick Paul Walsh, VP of Education and Director of the SDG Academy. Tawfik Jelassi, Assistant Director General for Communication and Information, signed on behalf of UNESCO.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="950" height="717" src="https://sdgacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/OER-partnership-launch.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4476" style="aspect-ratio:16/9;object-fit:cover" srcset="https://sdgacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/OER-partnership-launch.png 950w, https://sdgacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/OER-partnership-launch-300x226.png 300w, https://sdgacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/OER-partnership-launch-768x580.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></figure>



<p>The Joint Committee aims to enhance the availability of open educational resources (OERs) for sustainable development. It has become increasingly important to ensure all people have the skills and knowledge needed to achieve the SDGs. Unfortunately, although much of the expertise needed to make progress towards our global goals already exists, it is woefully inaccessible behind paywalls, or difficult to find among the array of unverified information available online. Consequently, high quality resources need to be made available as OERs, and organized in efficient and effective ways for widescale uptake and use.</p>



<p>It is the purpose of the Joint Committee to promote the commitments made in the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/legal-affairs/recommendation-open-educational-resources-oer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UNESCO&nbsp;2019 Recommendation on Open Educational Resources</a></span>. Unanimously adopted by the UNESCO General Conference in 2019, the Recommendation aims to support the development and strengthening of inclusive knowledge societies. To put commitments into action, the Joint Committee has engaged a work plan to establish an innovative platform and repository of OERs for the SDGs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This initiative follows on issues highlighted during the UN Transforming Education Summit, hosted in 2022. During a session chaired by SDSN, and co-hosted by the Permanent Missions of Ireland and Ghana, partners emphasized the critical value of knowledge sharing for purposes of equity and inclusion. Partners, including UNESCO, UN Academic Impact, the International Association of Universities, and more advocated for comprehensive support to mainstream OERs to enhance global development.</p>



<p>The SDG Academy is grateful for the partnership with UNESCO to enhance the dissemination and use of OERs. Taking steps to advance knowledge sharing in fair and equitable ways is an essential foundation for a global movement to achieve the SDGs. The Joint Committee will initiate its work plan in 2023 and welcomes contributions from new partners.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As the world undergoes the ongoing transformation from dependence on fossil fuels to low-carbon economies, it has become imperative to ensure the labor force is prepared for the future we want. What is that future? Globally, we have come to a consensus on our need to establish a more sustainable world. Having agreed to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the ambitious targets of the Paris Climate Agreement, member states of the UN know where we need to go. Continuing to bring communities out of poverty, improving global health, enriching education and other social outcomes, and, perhaps most importantly, staying within critical climate targets that promote human survival, are universally accepted as our global goals.</p>



<p>Yet, consensus is not enough. It has become increasingly clear that to achieve our goals, we require market transitions and a shifting of the labor force to jobs that create more sustainable outcomes. Carbon heavy industries such as energy, agriculture, and consumer goods require a rethinking of current methods of production and delivery. <em>This calls for greater attention to the training and support given to people to perform their work sustainably, or to transition to more sustainable jobs and industries.</em></p>



<p>These topics were addressed recently at the edX Global Forum convened in Washington D.C. from October 2-4. In a session co-facilitated with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the SDG Academy discussed the value of upskilling the current workforce, and doing it at scale. Jessica Crist, Education Manager for the SDG Academy, summarized this when stating that “the desire to be sustainable exists and the knowledge is out there, but industry workers do not have the necessary skills to make this a reality.”</p>



<p>Emphasized was the need to create a truly intergenerational effort and a ‘just transition.’ To meet our climate goals by 2030, we must educate and train the current generation of workers. To continue the progress needed to 2050 and beyond, we must invest in education, develop curricula, and ensure teachers are trained to facilitate learning for sustainable development.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, the SDG Academy discussed the need for a ‘just transition’ meaning securing workers’ rights and livelihoods as economies shift. The IPCC defines this as “a set of principles, processes and practices that aim to ensure that no people, workers, places, sectors, countries or regions are left behind in the transition from a high-carbon to a low carbon economy.”</p>



<p>To work towards these goals, the SDG Academy has collaborated with edX, one of the world’s premiere providers of massive open online courses (MOOCs), to create training programs offered to the platform&#8217;s nearly 40 million users. To date, the SDG Academy has launched three professional certificates and one Masters pathway to serve the need of upskilling for 2030. The professional certificates include: 1. Foundations of Sustainable Development, 2. Sustainable Water Management, and 3. Sustainable Cities and Urban Development. The Masters pathway (in partnership with University College Dublin) allows learners to study at their own pace, an often critical factor in enabling workers to pursue further education, to eventually enroll in an accredited degree program.</p>



<p>Find more about the SDG Academy’s professional certificates <a href="https://www.edx.org/school/sdgacademyx#programs">here</a>.</p>



<p>Midway through the SDG Agenda, it is evident that progress must be accelerated to achieve our global goals. Deepened support for transitioning labor markets is essential to get the world on a path towards achieving sustainable development, and upskilling the current workforce must become a central focus of how we are facilitating this important transition. The SDG Academy remains grateful to the partnership with edX as we further our work together to promote education and training for the SDGs.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Official Key messages:<em>&nbsp;</em></h2>



<p><em>•</em><em> </em>Ensure that scientific data, OER and research findings are openly accessible to the public, policymakers, and stakeholders, to build trust and promote informed decision-making.</p>



<p>• Besides making knowledge and scientific research accessible, we must equip decision-makers with the skills to use this information effectively. Since legislators and policymakers have short terms, we need institutional capacity-building for ongoing training and dialogue.</p>



<p>• Actively engage various sectors, such as government, academia, businesses, and civil society, in collaborative efforts to address key sustainability challenges, including energy, education, and digital connectivity.</p>



<p>• Establish common ethical principles in knowledge production and ensure inclusivity in research and innovation processes to create solutions that benefit all, regardless of background or location.</p>



<p>• Support scientific endeavors motivated by curiosity and a commitment to advancing the common good, fostering innovation and creative problem-solving.</p>



<p>• Promote geographical diversity and representation in scientific efforts to address local and regional challenges effectively.</p>



<p>• Explore avenues to attract global investment capital to efforts that contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>



<p>• Improve communication of how scientific research impacts people&#8217;s daily lives, covering aspects like safety, health, employment, and economic prosperity, to enhance public understanding and engagement.</p>



<p>• Allocate more resources at the United Nations to science, technology, and innovation (STI) areas while strengthening partnerships and involving all stakeholders.</p>

<p>The SDSN recently partnered with Sunway Malls, the Jeffrey Sachs Center on Sustainable Development (JSC) at Sunway University, the Malaysian Retailers Association (MRA), and the Malaysian Retail Chain Association (MRCA) to launch the Sustainability Collaboration Action Network (SCAN), a capacity-building collaboration for the Malaysian retail sector. SCAN is the first alliance network in Malaysia to solely focus on sustainability in the retail industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sunwaymalls.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sunway Malls</span></a>, part of the Sunway Group, is one of Malaysia’s largest mall owner-operators and a leader in sustainable retail practices. Recognizing that the retail industry has a significant role to play in sustainable development, Sunway Malls has set ambitious resource consumption and waste reduction goals and enlisted the SDSN’s SDG Academy to help design foundational SDG training for its retail tenants. The inclusion of the MRA and the MRCA, two of the largest retail industry organizations in the country, has helped to further expand efforts to the entire Malaysian retail community.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2023/08/25/sunway-malls-to-spread-sustainability-in-retail-sector" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SCAN was formally launched on August 24 at Sunway University</span></a>, host of SDSN’s Kuala Lumpur office. In addition to launching SCAN, the event announced the creation of the ReX (Retail Extended Learning) platform, a three-tiered educational program to train the entire sector. It begins with an online course that covers the basics of sustainability and the SDGs, as well as practical topics, including water, energy, and waste management; green leases; green procurement; and green fit-out. The SDG Academy served as an advisor in the development of Sunway Malls&#8217; original content and provided materials from its online catalog to give global context to the need for a sustainable retail industry. Sunway Malls is now offering the course for free to Malaysia’s nearly one million retail-sector employees as a public good.</p>



<p>In addition to the online course, ReX’s offerings will include microcredential programs organized by the JSC and pathways for retail managers and executives into JSC’s <a href="https://jeffreysachs.center/master-sustainable-development" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Master in Sustainable Development Management</span></a> program.&nbsp;</p>
